# Hosting farmOS

farmOS is a web-based application that can be installed and hosted on a web
server, much like a website. This allows it to be accessed by multiple people
simultaneously, from any device with a web browser and internet connection.

## Self hosting

If you are familiar with hosting database-backed websites, you can install
farmOS on your own web server.

farmOS is [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software), which
means you are free to download the code and host it yourself. You are also free
to modify and extend it to fit your needs.

For more information, including server requirements, refer to
[Installing farmOS](/hosting/install).

To understand how to update farmOS when a new version is released, refer to
[Updating farmOS](/hosting/update).

## Subscription hosting

If you are not comfortable hosting and maintaining your own server,
subscription hosting allows you to get started with farmOS quickly and easily.

"*farmOS as a service*", including hosting, automatic updates, backups, SSL
