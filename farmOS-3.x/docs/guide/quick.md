# Quick forms

farmOS provides a framework for building "quick forms" for common data entry
needs. This allows a simplified and focused UI to be provided for fast and easy
recording of common events, while maintaining the underlying flexibility of
the generalized Asset and Log data architecture.

If you have the "farmOS Quick" module enabled, you will see a new "Quick forms"
link in the toolbar. This will list all available quick forms, which are
provided by modules.
